First attempt at using CSS to design a webpage

This was an attempt to re-create a web-page design from The Odin Project but customised.
I learned a lot from this project. Although I am just starting web development, I quickly realised while creating my CSS layout that ordering my code in an organised and easy to reference way is very important. I am going to be spending considerable effort to learn the best ways to do this from now on. additionally, although the syllabus I'm following hasn't introduced me to the concept yet, I realised while doing this project that coding in pixels exactly is likely not a good idea when it comes to web development. I can already see it doesn't transition well to different screen sizes and screen resolution densities. This is also something I'm going to be aware of and improve from here on.
